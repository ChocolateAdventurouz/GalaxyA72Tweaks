# READ ME!
I am not the original author. I just took files from [NcX Rom](https://github.com/ShaDisNX255/NcX_Stock) ([@ShaDisNX255](https://github.com/ShaDisNX255)) and  [@UltraHQ's](https://github.com/UltraHQ) [A72 CSC Mods](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-CSC-Mods) made for OneUI 4.1 becuase NcX Rom is not available for a72q & "A72 Mods/CSC Mods" were not working on OneUI 6 (bootloops).

## Downloads

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ChocolateAdventurouz/GalaxyA72Tweaks/releases) | Mirror: [AndroidFileHost](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=341315)
## Uninstall
There should not be any system bootloop or issue on module uninstall, but it is advised you take a backup just in case something happens. 
Sometimes, if the module is uninstalled, the boot process will take a bit longer. If so, that's normal, as OneUI seems to do a "restoration" to its apps (doesn't remove user data)
## Regarding Camera
OneUI 6's stock camera app seems to crash on any custom camera-features.xml file for a72q. Using the camera-features.xml from NcX Rom (a52q variant) seems to work great on a72q!

## Regarding Slow Animations
A72 is a midrange phone (unable to handle ui stuff like real-time live blur properly), and that's one of the reasons Samsung kept away these features, so if you have a really serious problem with it, just don't use that module or change your phone.

## Features
- Disabled DRC (compresses sound awfully)
- Full Edge Lighting
- Voice Recorder "Interview Mode"
- Real-time live blur
- Japanese Boot Animation
- [CSC Mods](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-CSC-Mods) by [@UltraHQ](https://github.com/UltraHQ)
- Galaxy A52 (a52q) camera-features.xml
- Various build.prop & floating-feature.xml tweaks (mostly fixes, not direct performance boost)
